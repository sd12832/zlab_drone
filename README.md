>““Owning a drone does not a pilot make.” - **Alex Morritt, Impromptu Scribe**

This project was initiated when I was a Project Assistant at the Zero Energy Networks Lab in the Department of Electronic Systems Engineering (DESE) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), working on a prototype framework for the combined indoor and outdoor navigation of a Parrot AR.Drone. 

Future plans involved working with the SLAM algorithm and improving on the Potential Fields Method. This project can be useful for two sets of people:

  - People curious about the use of ROS and C++ to make an Autonomous vehicle. 
  - People who want to **investigate** how to build a Computer Vision algorihm that detects and closes the gap to reach a specific visiual cue with the help of a **PID**.   
 
  
# Tech

- *ROS*
- *C++*
- *OpenCV*

 
### Todos

 - Test more extensively on the flight of the autonomous drone. 
 - Start building a UI for testing purposes!
